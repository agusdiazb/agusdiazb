### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm AgustÃ­n. I'm a psychologist and data analyst ðŸ˜„


As a data analyst, I bring a unique perspective to the field thanks to my extensive experience in psychology research. I have a deep understanding of research methodology, data collection and data analysis which enables me to deliver high-quality insights and recommendations based on solid data.


During my time as a researcher I worked in a systematic review and meta-analysis about emotion recognition models (a subfield of AFFECTIVE COMPUTING, a novel field that seeks to include emotions into the Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
